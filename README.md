# MADbot
MIT Pokerbots 2016 Submission for HU PLO

### MADbotv1.0
First submission; performed averagely when played with other bots during Casino Day 1; bot may have been too aggressive and not started to play less risky when bankroll is far too negative. MADbotv1.0 doesn't consider bets made by opponent and doesn't consider any history. Fixes to be made; consider bets in some way (unclear), and more strongly restrict actions when bankroll is very negative. 

### MADbotv1.1
Only minor tweaks to thresholds were made; MADbotv1.1 is less aggressive, but sufficient stops on behavior after bankroll is negative aren't enforced absolutely, but are stronger.
